# Custom Command Intepreter
This is only for fun, do not use this for malicious stuff.
Unfortunately, this is not a seperate command line intepreter, as it runs using the Microsoft Windows Command Prompt. This means that this can only be run using Windows.
Also, if you don't know the commands used for the interpreter, just type help for commands.
