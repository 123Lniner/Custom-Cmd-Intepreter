# Custom Command Intepreter
This is only for fun, do not use this for malicious stuff.
Unfortunately, this is not a seperate command line intepreter, as it runs using the Microsoft Windows Command Prompt. This means that this can only be run using Windows.
Also, if you don't know the commands used for the interpreter, just type help for commands.

# Command Help
Commands are not completely case sensitive.
Doing it completely lowercase or uppercase will work, but alternating cases won't.

You can also do windows cmd commands by navigating to "%systemroot%\system32\" (which should be the default), typing RUN, and typing the command (dir will not work).
